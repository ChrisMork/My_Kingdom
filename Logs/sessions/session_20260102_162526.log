Please continue with where you left off. You were working on the path finding and the base gameplay for the game, please take a look through the job manager.py to see what you were working on. You crashed so I am not sure where you left off. I also had mentioned adding a wagon that stores all the resources that the sprites go and collect. Also please from now on create a log file that contains all of the prompts I say, followed by each step that you followed through with everytime. That way if you ever crash again you can look at that
